The program getGeneLength.pl takes a file with read count matrix file RNA-SEQ data generated by tools such as HTSeq where the identifier is ensemble gene_id. This returns a file appending a column at the end with gene lenght, which could be used further to calculate FPKM/RPKM.

Usage: 

1. Open the script and enter the input file name in line 15.
2. perl getGeneLength.pl > OutputFile.txt
